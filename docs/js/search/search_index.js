The Janus documentation and demos are great for understanding how\nthe service works. However, the sample client code is not that easy to adopt\ninto your own application. This makes it so that developers need to write a lot\nof the low level code themselves and understand many of the low level details\nof the videoroom plugin. While more knowledge is always better than less, we\nbelieve it's possible to implement a videoroom without requiring the developer\nto understand intimate details of webrtc.\nWhat does this implement?\nThe core function provided by this library is a component called JanusVideoroomComponent that implements a videoroom. The selector for the component is janus-videoroom. You can have a fully functional videoroom only specifying the URL of the janus gateway and the room ID. The videoroom supports the following features:\n\nRoom ID You can specify any roomId that is available on the janus gateway.\nhttp and websocket connections You can specify an http and/or websocket URL. The component will prefer the websocket URL and fallback to the http URL.\nPINs You can specify a PIN for any room that requires it.\nAuto Resize Videos are automatically enlarged to take up the maximum screen real estate upon changing the size or orientation of the screen.\nMultiple Aspect Ratios Different source video aspect ratios are handled smoothly.\nDisplay Names You can specify the display name for anyone joining a videoroom.\nPublishers or Read Only Users Users can be publishers, who will send a feed from their camera/microphone, or they can be read only users that don't transmit anything.\nDevices Device IDs can be input and dynamically changed so that users can change which input or output devices to use.\nICE Servers In addition the the janus gateway, custom STUN/TURN servers can be specified.\nMute Audio Audio can be muted for publishers.\n\nWhat does this not implement?\nIn the spirit of doing one thing well, the janus-videoroom component does not\nimplement many necessary parts of an application. For example, the component\nsupports muting the feed of a publisher. However, it does not implement a mute\nbutton. The burden is put on the developer to implement the UX around how to\nmute a feed.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of necessary items for most webapps that\nare not implemented by JanusVideoroomComponent. These will have to be\nimplemented by the application outside of this library.\n\nJanus room configuration Create/edit/delete operations on janus rooms are not supported\nUI elements for interaction Mute, change device, etc. are supported by the component, but it does not include UI elements for these.\nUser Authentication\nBackend Storage\nJanus gateway deployment\n\nHow to use\nInstallation\nDependencies\njanus-angular has 3 peer dependencies: webrtc-adapter, @ngrx/component-store, and moment. These can be installed by yarn\nyarn add webrtc-adapter @ngrx/component-store momentInstalling janus-angular\nInstallation is available through yarn\nyarn add janus-angularIncluding the module\nThe JanusModule must be included in your imports for the module in which you wish to use the directive\nimport { JanusModule } from 'janus';\n...\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    ...\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    JanusModule,\n  ],\n})\nexport class YourAppModule { }Using the directive\nThe following minimal component will work with the demo deploy of janus.\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],\n  template: `\n    \n    \n  `\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  roomId = 1234;\n  wsUrl = 'wss://janus.conf.meetecho.com/ws';\n}Inputs/Outputs for the component are documented in the API docs on this site. Page for the\ncomponent docs is here\nFuture Work\nIn addition to tireless bug fixing and making sure it works on all platforms\nand networks, future work will include adding additional touchpoints in which\nsomeone can customize the videoroom. Overlays work great to give rough\nfunctionality to all supported features. However, there are often times when an\napp wants to implement buttons on a publisher video itself, or change the\nentire look and feel of the videoroom.\nSource Code\nSource code for this library
