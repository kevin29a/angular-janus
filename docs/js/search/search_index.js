This is\nspecified at audio_level_average in the room. This isn't practical if you\ndon't know the publisher's system setup ahead of time. We set the\naudio_level_average to 127 in the backend configuration. That makes the\nstart/stop talking events good for knowing if the remote user has muted.\nYou might want to ignore this information depending on your use case.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                        displayName\n                                \n                                \n                                        id\n                                \n                                \n                                        muted\n                                \n                                \n                                        volume\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        displayName\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        displayName:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Display name of the publisher \n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        id\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        id:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Janus ID of the publisher \n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        muted\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        muted:         boolean\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         boolean\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Set to true iff the last volume event had the volume at 127 \n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        volume\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        volume:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Current volume of the publisher's audio.

a videoroom\ninto any angular app. Once you have a properly configured, public instance of a\njanus server with the videoroom plugin enabled, this library includes a\ndirective that will connect clients in a videoroom.\nWhy build this?\nWhen building a product that incorporates a videoroom, the interesting part of\nthe product is how it helps users find, create, edit, join, and view\nvideorooms. That's what gives the product it's competitive advantage. However,\nwhen we started working on our own product, we spent the vast majority of our\nengineering time working with low level webrtc signalling. This mismatch led us\nto believe there's room for improvement in this field. Our goal is to help\nother developers spend more time on their app and less time on webrtc details.\nThe Janus documentation and demos are great for understanding how the service\nworks. However, the sample client code is not easy to adopt into your own\napplication. This makes it so that developers need to write a lot of the low\nlevel code themselves and understand many of the details of the videoroom\nplugin. While more knowledge is always better than less, we believe it's\npossible to implement a videoroom without requiring the developer to understand\nintimate details of webrtc.\nWhat does this implement?\nThe core function provided by this library is a component called JanusVideoroomComponent that implements a videoroom. The selector for the component is janus-videoroom. You can have a fully functional videoroom only specifying the URL of the janus gateway and the room ID. The videoroom supports the following features:\n\nRoom ID You can specify any roomId that is available on the janus gateway.\nhttp and websocket connections You can specify an http and/or websocket URL. The component will prefer the websocket URL and fallback to the http URL.\nPINs You can specify a PIN for any room that requires it.\nAuto Resize Videos are automatically enlarged to take up the maximum screen real estate upon changing the size or orientation of the screen.\nMultiple Aspect Ratios Different source video aspect ratios are handled smoothly.\nDisplay Names You can specify the display name for anyone joining a videoroom.\nPublishers or Read Only Users Users can be publishers, who will send a feed from their camera/microphone, or they can be read only users that don't transmit anything.\nSimulcast Supported clients will publish 3 different quality video feeds and clients will dynamically pick the appropriate stream based on current network conditions\nDevices Device IDs can be input and dynamically changed so that users can change which input or output devices to use.\nICE Servers In addition the the janus gateway, custom STUN/TURN servers can be specified.\nMute Audio Audio can be muted for publishers.\nSupported Platforms Tested and works on Chrome (Windows, macOS, and android) and Safari (macOS and iOS).\n\nWhat does this not implement?\nIn the spirit of doing one thing well, the janus-videoroom component does not\nimplement many necessary parts of an application. For example, the component\nsupports muting the feed of a publisher. However, it does not implement a mute\nbutton. The burden is put on the developer to implement the UX around how to\nmute a feed.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of necessary items for most webapps that\nare not implemented by JanusVideoroomComponent. These will have to be\nimplemented by the application outside of this library.\n\nJanus room configuration Create/edit/delete operations on janus rooms are not supported\nUI elements for interaction Mute, change device, etc. are supported by the component, but it does not include UI elements for these.\nUser Authentication\nBackend Storage\nJanus gateway deployment\n\nHow to use\nInstallation\nDependencies\njanus-angular has 3 peer dependencies: webrtc-adapter, @ngrx/component-store, and moment. These can be installed by yarn\nyarn add webrtc-adapter @ngrx/component-store momentInstalling janus-angular\nInstallation is available through yarn\nyarn add janus-angularIncluding the module\nThe JanusModule must be included in your imports for the module in which you wish to use the directive\nimport { JanusModule } from 'janus-angular';\n...\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    ...\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    JanusModule,\n  ],\n})\nexport class YourAppModule { }Using the directive\nThe following minimal component will work with the demo deploy of janus.\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],\n  template: `\n    \n    \n  `\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  roomId = 1234;\n  wsUrl = 'wss://janus.conf.meetecho.com/ws';\n}Inputs/Outputs for the component are documented in the API docs on this site. Page for the\ncomponent docs is here\nSample Application\nWe have written a small, sample application to show how to use the library. The\nrepo lives here.\nJanus setup\nThis is a client library tightly coupled with a Janus webrtc Server with the\nvideoroom plugin.  The documentation for that can be found on that Janus\nwebsite here.\nFuture Work\nIn addition to tireless bug fixing and making sure it works on all platforms\nand networks, future work will include adding additional touchpoints in which\nsomeone can customize the videoroom. Overlays work great to give rough\nfunctionality to all supported features. However, there are often times when an\napp wants to implement buttons on a publisher video itself, or change the\nentire look and feel of the videoroom. We do this internally, and are working\nto release those touchpoints to the public package.\nDonations\nAre you happy with the product and want to support future development? We\naccept donations\nhere.
